#HackTheWeb

The concept is to build automaticated realtime pipes through services even if they do not expose API.

Web is the most interconnecting place. it was build for that.  
To be interconnected, you have to be open, value will come from the number of links used you have weaved.
But our contemporary world is not ready yet to be open, lot of businesses and mind control is made by opacity, people keep thinking it is the good way to go to keep control of.  
Others think we could open up our world now to share, aggregate, merge, create, and evolve every time quicker.

As we have created Machines to make us more productive, let's pursuit this way to his paroxysm.

## Concept

HackTheWeb is designed to interconnect things through what User have access to.

> e.g. :  
> * Control your social data (twitter / facebook), servers / cloud / domain name, services 
> * Extract local ads from many services and get notified when new product corresponding to your needs is on your area
> * Grab your bank accounts data, and find who is taking you too much money, as its competitors are really cheaper.
> * etc...

It's crowd hacking, so every one who want to participate could be part of the hack, by coding, crawling, storing, or just routing things to other need with a simple browser.

This will create a Multidimensional Augmented Web based on Human/Community point of view and not on Services one's

So let's Hack

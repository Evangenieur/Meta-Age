#HackTheWeb

The concept is to build automaticated **realtime pipes** through services even if they _do not expose API_.

Web is the most **interconnecting place**. it was build for that.  
To be interconnected, you have to be **open**, value will come from the number of **links used** you have weaved.
But our *contemporary world* is not ready yet to be open, lot of **businesses** and **mind control** is made by *__opacity__*, people keep thinking it is the good way to go to **keep control of**.  
Others think we could open up our world now to share, aggregate, merge, create, and evolve every time quicker.

As we have created Machines to make us more **productive**, let's pursuit this way to his **paroxysm**.

## Concept

**HackTheWeb** is designed to interconnect things through what User have access to.

> e.g. :  
> * Control your social data (twitter / facebook), servers / cloud / domain name, services 
> * Extract local ads from many services and get notified when new product corresponding to your needs is on your area
> * Grab your bank accounts data, and find who is taking you too much money, as its competitors are really cheaper.
> * etc...

It's **crowd hacking**, so every one who want to participate could be part of the hack, by coding, crawling, storing, or just routing things to other need with a simple browser.

This will create a Multidimensional Augmented Web based on Human/Community point of view and not on Services one's

So let's **Hack the matrix**

## Terminology 

[**nickname**] : representing @individual, !group, (secret agency), /dev/null

[**online**] : representing which is online on a LinkedSpace : nickname, resources, linkedSpaces

[**resources**] : reprensenting ressources offered by [online]s [browser]'s and [node]'s

[**linkedSpace**] : a Network of [online]s

[**linkedObject**] : a Network of [Object]

[**Object**] : a state [Component]

[**Network**] : a Communicationnal [Component]

[**Code**] : a Processing [Component]

[**Component**]

  * URI: reference identifier

  * Revision: a tracking-number identifier of the timed state of the object in a given environment

  * MetaData: data linked to the object for a given revision

  * stream: 
    input: 
    ouput:
    fullduplex:

  * object: URI of himself ?

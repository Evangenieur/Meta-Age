### Creating and Handling MetaStability of the Web

As we are more interconnected to our world, things are going faster form birth to death.  
But to survive those things on their environment have to create more and more interconnections.  
When they die, all those interconnections just disappear.   
Affecting each linked things that are by someway dependent.  
Internet is growing faster and faster each day on a "multitude" of dimensions ( Web Of (Services|Clouds|Things|Data|Semantic|Mobility|Sensor|Humans|Bots) )

So to get the rest of the story about our [WebR?(e|E)volution](http://bit.ly/QMXvxd) we have to create new tools to enhance :

* Productivity : don't do things that a computer could do. (e.g. : copy / paste doesn't have to copy data once, but to create a known link between nodes to stream not the data but data URI as ID )
* Efficiency : extract revelant information from all your data flow (Mail, Twitter, Facebook) and make you aware of the importance. use collective intelligence, semantic inferency, etc..
* Resiliency : things could die without impacting you too severely, you always have quick alternative if all your stack is fully open sources
* Experimenting : Interconnecting all those things doesn't have to be painful. All things created by others should be pluggable now to experiment in few minutes.
